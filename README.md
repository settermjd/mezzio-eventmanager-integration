# Mezzio / Laminas EventManager Integration

This project provides a simplistic way of integrating laminas-eventmanager with Mezzio projects that are (originally) scaffolded with [the Mezzio Skeleton][mezzio-url], making it almost trivial to subscribe listeners to events.

> [!TIP]
> If you're new to Mezzio, check out [Mezzio Essentials][mezzioessentials-url] a practical, hands-on guide, which steps you through how to build an application, from start to finish.

## Prerequisites

To use this project, you need the following:

- Composer installed globally
- PHP 8.3 or 8.4

## Usage

To use the package with an existing Mezzio application, use Composer to add the package as a dependency to your project, as in the following example:

```bash
composer require mezzio-eventmanager-integration
```

### How to subscribe listeners to events

Then, to subscribe listeners to events, you need to do two things:

1. Add a `listeners` element to the application's configuration, listing the events and the listeners that are subscribed to those events, along with the [priority][laminas-eventmanager-priority-url] to subscribe them at (which is optional).
   There are three things to be aware of here:
     - If you don't assign a priority, a listener will be subscribed with a default priority of **1**
     - Higher priority values execute **earlier**
     - Lower (negative) priority values execute **later**
1. The listeners **must** be registered as services in the DI container.

There are many ways to add a `listeners` element to the application's configuration, but likely the simplest is to create a new file in the _config/autoload_ directory named _listeners.global.php_, and in that file add a configuration similar to the example below.

```php
<?php

return [
    'listeners' => [
        'add-item' => [
            [
                'listener' => FakeLoggerListener::class,
                'priority' => 10,
            ],
            [
                'listener' => FakeNotificationListener::class,
                'priority' => 20,
            ]
        ],
        'update-item' => [
           [
                'listener' => FakeLoggerListener::class,
           ]
        ],
        'delete-item' => [
            [
                'listener' => FakeNotificationListener::class,
                'priority' => 10,
            ],
        ],
    ],
];
```

Assuming the configuration above was used:

- `FakeLoggerListener` and `FakeNotificationListener` are subscribed to the "add-item" event
- `FakeLoggerListener` is subscribed to the "update-item" with a priority of "1" as a priority was not specified
- `FakeNotificationListener` is subscribed to the "delete-item" event

When the "add-item" event is triggered, `FakeLoggerListener` will execute first as it has a lower priority, then `FakeNotificationListener` will execute (assuming that execution isn't [short-circuited][laminas-eventmanager-shortcircuiting-url]).
